    question: "What is a Moroccan sovereign cloud?",
    answers: [
      "A sovereign Cloud Morocco refers to data hosting in a data center located within the national territory, ensuring that this data remains under the control of Moroccan jurisdiction, in full compliance with Law 09-08 on personal data protection, Law 05-20 on cybersecurity, and the recommendations of the CNDP (National Commission for the Protection of Personal Data).",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Who should choose sovereign cloud hosting in Morocco?",
    answers: [
      "Sovereign cloud hosting is intended for any entity handling sensitive or critical data in Morocco, whether public institutions or private companies. In sectors ranging from government and healthcare to finance, telecommunications, education, industry, or justice, data sovereignty provides essential guarantees: compliance with Moroccan legislation, enhanced protection against external threats and interference, and full control over strategic information.",
      "Each sector benefits in its own way — protecting citizens' privacy, ensuring national security, safeguarding business confidentiality, or gaining a competitive edge — illustrating why the sovereign cloud is now a cornerstone of Morocco's digital strategy.",
    ],

  {
    question: "What are the benefits of the sovereign cloud in Morocco?",
    answers: [
      "The sovereign cloud in Morocco offers several key advantages for organizations and institutions operating within the country:",
      "<ul><li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensures full alignment with Moroccan laws, including Law 09-08 on personal data protection and Law 05-20 on cybersecurity.</li><li><strong>Data Sovereignty:</strong> Keeps sensitive and strategic data within national borders, under Moroccan jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Reduces exposure to foreign surveillance and external cyber threats through advanced security protocols and local data governance.</li><li><strong>Improved Trust:</strong> Builds confidence among citizens, clients, and partners by protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data.</li><li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Local data centers ensure lower latency, better speed, and higher availability.</li><li><strong>Support for National Strategy:</strong> Strengthens Morocco's digital independence and supports the national vision for technological and economic development.</li><li><strong>Custom Services:</strong> Enables tailored solutions adapted to the specific needs of regulated sectors like healthcare, education, finance, and public administration.</li></ul>",

    question: "What's the difference between shared hosting and Cloud VPS?",
    answers: [
      "Our shared cloud hosting solution is based on sharing system resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) between multiple websites hosted on the same server. In contrast, with a Cloud VPS, you benefit from dedicated, guaranteed, and isolated resources. On the shared platform, we manage the entire configuration, including security and the hosting environment.",
      "However, Cloud VPS users are responsible for these technical aspects—unless they choose to delegate them to our experts.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to activate my shared hosting plan?",
    answers: [
      "There is no delay in the delivery of your Cloud Morocco hosting package. The activation time mainly depends on the payment method used. For example, credit card payments allow for instant activation of your hosting package.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to deliver my Cloud VPS server?",
    answers: [
      "Cloud Morocco VPS servers are custom-configured to meet each client's specific needs.",
      "Delivery time depends on both the payment method used and how quickly you provide the necessary details, which should first be discussed with our sales team.",
