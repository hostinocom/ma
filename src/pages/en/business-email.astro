    question: "What are the advantages of using Maily®?",
    answer: `A professional email address (e.g., your.name@yourcompany.ma) allows you to communicate efficiently with your clients, suppliers, and team members — both in Morocco and internationally.<br><br>It strengthens your company's credibility, builds trust, secures your communications, and reflects a serious and well-organized brand image.`,

  {
    question:
      "What's the difference between Maily® and the email accounts included with web hosting?",
    answers: [
      "Maily® is a premium cloud email solution, designed for businesses seeking performance, security, and reliability. Hosted on a dedicated infrastructure, Maily adheres to the highest security standards, ensures optimal speed, and delivers a seamless collaboration experience — with no issues in sending or receiving emails.",
      "In contrast, email addresses included with standard web hosting packages (such as Webmail via cPanel) are often limited in terms of performance, storage space, deliverability, and support. While suitable for basic use, they are not built to meet the demands of modern professional communication.",

  {
    question: "Can I change my plan at any time?",
    answers: [
      "Yes. At Hostino, we understand that your needs may evolve, so we've made it easy to upgrade your plan without any service interruption.",
      "Our system automatically calculates the prorated amount and applies the upgrade as soon as your order is confirmed.",

  {
    question:
